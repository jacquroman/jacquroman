👋 Hi, I’m Jacqueline — a former Software Engineer turned Solutions Engineer.

💡 I build automation tools, AI workflows, and technical demos that streamline go-to-market operations, shorten sales cycles, and increase team productivity.

🧰 I work with Python, JavaScript/React, Zapier, Salesforce, and APIs (OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), Samsara).

🌱 Currently building: an AI-powered sales assistant + internal SE tools using Relevance AI, Zapier, and the Samsara API.

🚀 Interested in collaborating on GTM automation, AI agents, or tools that make technical sales teams more efficient.
